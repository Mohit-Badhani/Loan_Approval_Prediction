# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant details using supervised machine learning models. It helps financial institutions make faster, data-driven loan decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a dataset of loan applicants containing information like income, credit history, education, and employment, the goal is to build a model that predicts whether a loan should be approved or not.
